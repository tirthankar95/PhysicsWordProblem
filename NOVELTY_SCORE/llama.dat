{A 2 kg block is attached to a horizontal, massless spring with a spring constant of 100 N/m. The block is displaced by 0.2 m from its equilibrium position and then released from rest. Assuming the block is subject to negligible air resistance, use Newton's second law of motion to determine the block's velocity after 2 seconds.}
{A car accelerates from rest to a speed of 25 m/s in 5 seconds. What is the average acceleration of the car during this time period?}
{A 5 kg box is pulled across a frictionless surface with a constant force of 20 N. If the box accelerates at a rate of 2 m/s², how far will it travel in 3 seconds?}
{A 10 kg object is dropped from a height of 20 m. Assuming negligible air resistance, use the equation of motion to determine the object's velocity when it hits the ground.}
{A car travels from rest to a speed of 30 m/s in 6 seconds. What is the average acceleration of the car during this time period?}
{A 3 kg block is attached to a horizontal, massless string and is pulled with a constant force of 15 N. If the block accelerates at a rate of 1.5 m/s², how far will it travel in 4 seconds?}
