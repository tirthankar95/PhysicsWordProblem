{A car starts from rest and accelerates uniformly at 2 m/s² for 10 seconds.

What is the final velocity of the car?
How far does the car travel in this time?
If the car continues to travel at this final velocity for another 5 seconds, what additional distance does it cover?}
{A car starts from rest and accelerates uniformly at 2 m/s² for 10 seconds.

What is the final velocity of the car?
How far does the car travel in this time?}
{A ball is thrown vertically upward with an initial velocity of 20 m/s.

How long does it take to reach the highest point?
What is the maximum height reached by the ball?}
{A motorcycle is traveling at a constant velocity of 30 m/s. The rider applies the brakes, causing a constant deceleration of 5 m/s².

How long does it take for the motorcycle to come to a complete stop?
What is the distance traveled by the motorcycle during this time?}
{A stone is dropped from the top of a tall building. It takes 4 seconds to hit the ground.

What is the velocity of the stone just before it hits the ground?
What is the height of the building?}
{Two cars, A and B, start from rest and accelerate uniformly. Car A accelerates at 3 m/s² and Car B accelerates at 4 m/s².

After 5 seconds, which car is moving faster and by how much?
How far has each car traveled in this time?}
