{A car of mass 1200 kg is traveling at a constant velocity of 25 m/s. The driver applies the brakes, and the car comes to a complete stop in 10 seconds. Assuming the braking force is constant:
Calculate the deceleration of the car.
Determine the braking force applied to stop the car.
If the same braking force is applied to a truck of mass 1800 kg moving at the same initial velocity, how long will it take for the truck to come to a complete stop?}
{A cyclist is riding at a constant speed of 10 m/s. The cyclist applies the brakes, causing a constant deceleration of 2 m/s².
How long will it take for the cyclist to come to a complete stop?
What distance will the cyclist travel during the time they are braking?
If the cyclist's mass is 70 kg, what is the magnitude of the braking force acting on them?}
{A rocket of mass 5000 kg is launched vertically upward from the ground. The engines produce a constant thrust force of 75,000 N, and the rocket experiences a gravitational force of g = 9.8 m/s².
Calculate the net force acting on the rocket.
Determine the acceleration of the rocket.
If the rocket starts from rest, how high will it travel in the first 10 seconds of its motion?}
{A train of mass 10,000 kg is moving on a straight track with an initial velocity of 15 m/s. The train's engine applies a constant braking force, and the train comes to a complete stop in 20 seconds.
Calculate the deceleration of the train.
Determine the force applied by the engine.
How far does the train travel during the braking period?}
{A ball of mass 0.5 kg is thrown vertically upward with an initial velocity of 20 m/s. 
Calculate the time it takes for the ball to reach its maximum height.
Determine the maximum height reached by the ball.
What is the velocity of the ball when it returns to the thrower's hand?}
