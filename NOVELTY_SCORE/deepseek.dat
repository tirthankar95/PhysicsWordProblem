{A car starts from rest and accelerates uniformly at 4 m/s². After 5 seconds, what is its velocity and how far has it traveled?}
{A car starts from rest and accelerates uniformly at a rate of 3 m/s². 
Calculate: 
a) The distance traveled by the car in 8 ,seconds. 
b) The velocity of the car at the end of 8 seconds.}
{A car starts from rest and accelerates uniformly at a rate of 2 m/s² for 10 seconds.
1.	What is the final velocity of the car?
2.	How far does the car travel during this time?}
{A ball is thrown vertically upward with an initial velocity of 20 m/s². Assume the acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 m/s²(acting downward).
1.	How long does it take for the ball to reach its maximum height?
2.	What is the maximum height the ball reaches?
3.	How long does it take for the ball to return to the ground?}
{A car starts from rest and accelerates uniformly at a rate of 2 m/s² for 5 s. What distance does it travel during this time?}
