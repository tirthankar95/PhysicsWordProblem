{A car accelerates uniformly from rest at a rate of 2.5m/s for 8 seconds. 
It then continues at a constant velocity for 10 seconds before decelerating uniformly at 3m/s until it comes to a stop.
(a) What is the maximum velocity attained by the car?
(b) What is the total distance traveled by the car?
(c) How long does the entire journey take?}
{A cyclist starts from rest and accelerates at a constant rate of 1.2m/s for 5 seconds. 
The cyclist then maintains a constant velocity for 15 seconds before slowing down uniformly at 
0.8 m/s until coming to a stop.
(a) What is the maximum speed reached by the cyclist?
(b) What is the total distance traveled by the cyclist?
(c) How long does the entire journey take?}
{A car is moving along a straight road with an initial velocity of 15m/s. The driver applies the brakes, causing the car to decelerate uniformly at 3 m/s2
(a) How long does it take for the car to stop?
(b) What is the total distance traveled by the car before coming to rest?
(c) If instead of stopping, the car continued to decelerate at the same rate for another 2 seconds, what would its final velocity be?}
{A train starts from rest and accelerates uniformly at 2 m/s2 for 12 seconds. 
It then moves at a constant speed for 20 seconds before decelerating uniformly at 1.5 m/s2 until it comes to a stop.
(a) What is the maximum speed attained by the train?
(b) What is the total distance traveled by the train?
(c) How long does the entire journey take?}
{A ball is dropped from the top of a 50-meter-high building. Neglecting air resistance, assume the acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 m/s2
(a) How long does it take for the ball to reach the ground?
(b) What is the velocity of the ball just before it hits the ground?
(c) If the ball rebounds with 60% of its impact speed, how high does it rise after bouncing?}
