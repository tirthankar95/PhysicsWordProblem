{A thief standing on a truck traveling at an initial velocity of 17 m/s at an angle 135 degrees with the horizontal throws a gold coin with a force of 42 N at an angle 78 degrees with the horizontal while the truck is on a bridge. If the gold coin experiences a displacement of 60 m at an angle 132 degrees with the horizontal and the train has an acceleration of 87 ms^-2, what is the mass of the gold coin and the time it takes for the gold coin to reach a final velocity of 8 m/s at an angle 92 degrees with the horizontal?}
{If a person standing at one end of a cave throws a ball with a force of 80 N towards a rock on the other end of the cave, with a displacement of 47 m and a time of 62 s, what is the initial velocity of the ball and what is the mass of the rock if the cave length is 1271 m and the final velocity of the ball upon impact is 53 m/s? Assume the ball and rock have the same acceleration.}
{A person on a locomotive is standing on a bridge and throws a ball with a horizontal component of initial velocity and a vertical component of initial velocity. The locomotive is accelerating at 80 ms^-2 at an angle of 73 degrees with the horizontal and has a length of 441 m. The ball lands on the bridge with a final velocity of 5 m/s at an angle of 82 degrees with the horizontal after a time of 30 seconds. If the displacement of the ball is 5 m at an angle of 134 degrees with the horizontal, what are the horizontal and vertical components of the initial velocity of the ball, as well as the horizontal and vertical components of the acceleration of the locomotive?}
{A person throws a ball and a rock horizontally from the same location in a cave with a length of 1221 m. The ball has an initial velocity of 34 m/s and experiences an acceleration of 11 ms^-2. After 62 seconds, the person discovers that the ball has traveled the entire length of the cave, but the rock has only traveled 915.5 m. What is the final velocity of the rock?}
{Cindy stands at the edge of a cliff and throws a ball with a mass of 0.5 kg and a rock with a mass of 2 kg into the ravine. If Cindy has a mass of 81 kg and throws the objects with an acceleration of 49 ms^-2 at an angle of 124 degrees with the horizontal, what is the horizontal and vertical component of the force exerted on the person?}
{A monkey standing on a train traveling at an initial velocity of 78 m/s at an angle 48 degrees with the horizontal, throws a ball with a force of 6 N at an angle 149 degrees with the horizontal while the train is on a bridge. The train has an acceleration of 35 ms^-2 at an angle 124 degrees with the horizontal. If the train is 952 m long and the ball takes 28 seconds to hit the ground, what is the horizontal and vertical acceleration of the train and the horizontal and vertical components of the final velocity of the ball when it hits the ground?}
