Prompt,Question
"Give me a physics question using the following variables and words.

 In a cave, person, ball, rock, cave length = 1581 m. final velocity = 93 m/s, time = 33 s, displacement = 26 m, acceleration = unknown, initial velocity = unknown.","
A person throws a ball from one end of a 1581 m long cave to the other, with a displacement of 26 m. If the ball reaches a final velocity of 93 m/s in 33 seconds, what was the acceleration and initial velocity of the ball?"
