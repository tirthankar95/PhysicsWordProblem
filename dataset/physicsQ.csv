"Generate one physics question using the following elements.
force = 18 N, mass = 95 kg, acceleration = unknown.","
    What is the acceleration of an object with a mass of 95 kg and a force of 18 N acting upon it?
   
    Answer: Using Newton's Second Law (F = m * a), we can solve for the acceleration:
    a = F / m
    a = 18 N / 95 kg
    a â‰ˆ 0.19 m/s^2
    Therefore, the acceleration of the object is approximately 0.19 m/s^2."
